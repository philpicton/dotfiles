# Dotfiles

This repo contains various configuration files for applications that I use. I am using GNU Stow to symlink these files from a local folder (`~/dotfiles` which I'm tracking in this repo) to their correct location.

There are many prerequisites necessary to have these files provide their full functionality, and a lot of the programs that these files configure prefer a particular operating system (by the way). Some don't.

## Installation

These notes are really for my own benefit. At some point my arch linux installation will get borked by some silly mistake that I make and I'll undoubtedly decide to start again with a fresh install.
